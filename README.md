# 🚀 Hey there, I'm Kendrick – Chief Bug Creator @ Luumitech 👨‍🚀

Welcome to my digital jungle, where code compiles (most of the time) and coffee is a food group. ☕

Play [Kendrick's Adventure](https://kendrickw.github.io/), my side-scrolling profile page.

## 🧠 Who am I?

I'm the **Founder** and **Principal Software Architect** of [Luumitech.com](https://luumitech.com) – which is just a fancy way of saying I break things *very strategically* and then pretend I meant to do it.

## 💻 What do I do?

> ✨ Full Stack Developer by day.
> 🧙‍♂️ Stack Whisperer by night.

- 🔥 Currently lighting things on fire with:
  - `TypeScript` – because who doesn't love types *and* pain?
  - `Next.js` – for when I want SSR, SSG, ISR, and other acronyms I pretend to fully understand.
  - `TailwindCSS` – because writing CSS is for people with too much time on their hands.

## 🧰 My Dev Toolbox

```ts
const stack = {
  frontend: ['Next.js', 'React', 'TailwindCSS', 'NextUI', 'ShadCN', 'TanStack'],
  backend: ['Node.js', 'Prisma', 'tRPC', 'MongoDB'],
  languages: ['TypeScript', 'JavaScript', 'HTML', 'CSS'],
  cloud: ['Google', 'Azure', 'AWS'],
  testing: ['Jest', 'Playwright'],
};
```

## 🧩 Open Source & Projects

Check out the public repositories I have been working on:
